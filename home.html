<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
  I have been coding for several years now, but i have been only focused on Python<br>
  Now i am moving on to public "applications" aka, websites. These are my first public<br>
  coding "demonstrations", and in all reality, i am doing this partially to show off to<br>
  my friends, but also to have a website that i can give my friends an update about my<br>
  life, etc.
