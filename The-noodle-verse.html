      <b>1. The Beginning of The Beat<br><i>(Before Time, before Noodles, before Up was Pickle)</i></b>
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the absolute void, where <b>nothing</b> had yet<br>
taken shape, there was only <b>The Beat</b>—an<br>
infinite, rhythmically pulsing force that<br>
existed without medium, matter, or meaning. The Beat did not <i>think</i>, nor did it<br>
<i>act</i>—it simply <b>was</b>, vibrating in endless<br>
cycles, waiting for something to respond.<br><br>
And one day (or perhaps every day, or no days at all, since time did not exist yet),<br>
something <b>did</b>.
