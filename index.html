<h2>About me</h2>
<hr>
<p>
  I have been coding for several years now, but I have been only focused on Python<br>
  Now I am moving on to public "applications" aka, websites. These are my first public<br>
  coding "demonstrations", and in all reality, I am doing this partially to show off to<br>
  my friends, but also to have a website that I can give my friends an update about my<br>
  life, etc.
</p>
<p>
  In regards to my other life(outside of coding), I have been playing piano for several<br>
  years, play minecraft, and skateboard. My plans for college are to go for computer<br>
  engineering at <a href="https://kettering.edu">Kettering</a> or <a href="https://oakland.edu">Oakland</a>.
</p>
  <p>UPDATE!
  I have recently started considering learning car mechanics to help my family with car problems</p>
